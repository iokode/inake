# Inake - Pronounceable word generator tool
Inake is a tool that generates non-existent pronounced words, randomly following some pronunciation rules for the Spanish language. It is useful for generating names for new projects.

The algorithm was originally written by [Javi Aibar](https://github.com/JaviAibar) in Java and ported to .NET in a series of live broadcasts on the [IOKode's Twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/iokode).

You can see the live broadcast in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXyzPIrJZLo&list=PLnxT_0JoBAuWM8DBF4kJozel_MM5zJaYd) (Spanish)

# Where does the name "Inake" come from
It was generated by this tool.

# Use as .NET library
Inake uses a random number generator to determinate the letters of the words. The number generator must be an instance that implements the `IOKode.Inake.RandomGenerators.IRandomGenerator` interface. A default implementation is provided that makes use of the System.Random class, this implementation is the `IOKode.Inake.RandomGenerators.SystemRandomGenerator` class.

Simply, you must instantiate the `IOKode.Inake.WordGenerator` class by injecting the random number generator instance in the constructor and calling the GenerateWord method passing it by parameter number of maximum letters that the generated word will have:

```cs
var generator = new WordGenerator(new SystemRandomGenerator());
var word = generator.GenerateWord(8);
```

It can be installed as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IOKode.Inake/).

## Install via Package Manager
`Install-Package IOKode.Inake -Version 1.0.0`

## Install via .NET CLI
`dotnet add package IOKode.Inake --version 1.0.0`

# Use as console application
Inake can be used as application console. Run the [console application project](https://github.com/iokode/inake/tree/main/IOKode.Inake.Program). You can use these parameters:
- -w, -words <Int32> Number of generated words. (Default: 1)
- -l, -letters <Int32> Number of letters per word. (Default: 8)
- -f, -fileName <String> If set, output to file, otherwise, output to console. (Default: null)

# Use a web application
You can deploy inake as ASP.NET Core 5 web application. See [web project](https://github.com/iokode/inake/tree/main/IOKode.Inake.Web).
